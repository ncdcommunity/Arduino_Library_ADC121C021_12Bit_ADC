ADC121C021:

These converters are low-power, monolithic, 12-bit,analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) that operates from a +2.7 to 5.5V supply. The converter is based upon a successive approximation register architecture with an internal track-and-hold circuit that can handle input frequencies up to 11MHz

Applications:

•System monitoring

•Peak detection

•Portable instrument

•Medical instrument

•Test equipements
